DESCRIPTION
     The nsysctl utility retrieves kernel state and allows processes with
     appropriate privilege to set kernel state.  The state to be retrieved or
     set is described using a "Management Information Base" ("MIB") style
     name, described as a dotted set of components.

     The following options are available:

     --libxo options
             Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human
             and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3)

     -A      Equivalent to -o -a (for compatibility).

     -a      List all the currently available non-opaque values.  This option
             is ignored if one or more variable names are specified on the
             command line.

     -b      Force the value of the variable(s) to be output in raw, binary
             format.  No names are printed and no terminating newlines are
             output.  This is mostly useful with a single variable.

     -B bufsize
             [NOT IMPLEMENTED] Set the buffer size to read from the nsysctl to
             bufsize.  This is necessary for a nsysctl that has variable
             length, and the probe value of 0 is a valid length, such as
             kern.arandom.

     -d      Print the description of the variable instead of its value.

     -e      Separate the name and the value of the variable(s) with `='.
             This is useful for producing output which can be fed back to the
             nsysctl utility.  This option is ignored if either -N or -n is
             specified, or a variable is being set.

     -F      [DOC]

     -f filename
             [NOT IMPLEMENTED] Specify a file which contains a pair of name
             and value in each line.  nsysctl reads and processes the
             specified file first and then processes the name and value pairs
             in the command line argument.

     -h      Format output for human, rather than machine, readability.

     -I      [DOC]

     -i      Ignore unknown mib-entries.  The purpose is to make use of
             nsysctl for collecting data from a variety of machines (not all
             of which are necessarily running exactly the same software)
             easier.

     -l      [DOC]

     -M      [DOC]

     -m      [DOC]

     -N      Show only variable names, not their values.  This is particularly
             useful with shells that offer programmable completion.  To enable
             completion of variable names in zsh(1) (ports/shells/zsh), use
             the following code:

                   listnsysctls () { set -A reply $(nsysctl -AN ${1%.*}) }
                   compctl -K listnsysctls nsysctl

             To enable completion of variable names in tcsh(1), use:

                   complete nsysctl 'n/*/`nsysctl -Na`/'

     -n      Show only variable values, not their names.  This option is
             useful for setting shell variables.  For instance, to save the
             pagesize in variable psize, use:

                   set psize=`nsysctl -n hw.pagesize`

     -o      Show opaque variables (which are normally suppressed).  The
             format and length are printed, as well as a hex dump of the first
             sixteen bytes of the value.

     -q      Suppress some warnings generated by nsysctl to standard error.

     -S      [DOC]

     -T      Display only variables that are settable via loader
             (CTLFLAG_TUN).

     -t      Print the type of the variable.

     -W      Display only writable variables that are not statistical.  Useful
             for determining the set of runtime tunable nsysctls.

     -X      Equivalent to -x -a (for compatibility).

     -x      As -o, but prints a hex dump of the entire value instead of just
             the first few bytes.

     -y      [DOC]

     The information available from nsysctl consists of integers, strings, and
     opaque types.  The nsysctl utility only knows about a couple of opaque
     types, and will resort to hexdumps for the rest.  The opaque information
     is much more useful if retrieved by special purpose programs such as
     ps(1), systat(1), and netstat(1).

     Some of the variables which cannot be modified during normal system
     operation can be initialized via loader(8) tunables.  This can for
     example be done by setting them in loader.conf(5).  Please refer to
     loader.conf(5) for more information on which tunables are available and
     how to set them.

     The string and integer information is summarized below.  For a detailed
     description of these variable see sysctl(3).

     The changeable column indicates whether a process with appropriate
     privilege can change the value.  String and integer values can be set
     using nsysctl.

EXIT STATUS
     The nsysctl utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     For example, to retrieve the maximum number of processes allowed in the
     system, one would use the following request:

           nsysctl kern.maxproc

     To set the maximum number of processes allowed per uid to 1000, one would
     use the following request:

           nsysctl kern.maxprocperuid=1000

     Information about the system clock rate may be obtained with:

           nsysctl kern.clockrate

     Information about the load average history may be obtained with:

           nsysctl vm.loadavg

COMPATIBILITY
     The -w option has been deprecated and is silently ignored.

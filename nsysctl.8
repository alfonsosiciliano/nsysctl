.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility retrieves kernel state and allows processes with appropriate
privilege to set kernel state.
The state to be retrieved or set is described using a
.Dq Management Information Base
.Pq Dq MIB
style name, described as a dotted set of
components.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl -libxo Ar options
Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human
and machine readable formats.
See xo_parse_args(3)
.It Fl A
Equivalent to
.Fl o a
(for compatibility).
.It Fl a
List all the currently available non-opaque values.
This option is ignored if one or more variable names are specified on
the command line.
.It Fl b
Force the value of the variable(s) to be output in raw, binary format.
No names are printed and no terminating newlines are output.
This is mostly useful with a single variable.
.It Fl B Ar bufsize
[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Set the buffer size to read from the
.Nm
to
.Ar bufsize .
This is necessary for a
.Nm
that has variable length, and the probe value of 0 is a valid length, such as
.Va kern.arandom .
.It Fl d
Print the description of the variable instead of its value.
.It Fl e
Separate the name and the value of the variable(s) with
.Ql = .
This is useful for producing output which can be fed back to the
.Nm
utility.
This option is ignored if either
.Fl N
or
.Fl n
is specified, or a variable is being set.
.It Fl F
[DOC]
.It Fl f Ar filename
[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Specify a file which contains a pair of name and value in each line.
.Nm
reads and processes the specified file first and then processes the name
and value pairs in the command line argument.
.It Fl h
Format output for human, rather than machine, readability.
.It Fl I
[DOC]
.It Fl i
Ignore unknown mib-entries.
The purpose is to make use of
.Nm
for collecting data from a variety of machines (not all of which
are necessarily running exactly the same software) easier.
.It Fl l
[DOC]
.It Fl M
[DOC]
.It Fl m
[DOC]
.It Fl N
Show only variable names, not their values.
This is particularly useful with shells that offer programmable
completion.
To enable completion of variable names in
.Xr zsh 1 Pq Pa ports/shells/zsh ,
use the following code:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
listnsysctls () { set -A reply $(nsysctl -AN ${1%.*}) }
compctl -K listnsysctls nsysctl
.Ed
.Pp
To enable completion of variable names in
.Xr tcsh 1 ,
use:
.Pp
.Dl "complete nsysctl 'n/*/`nsysctl -Na`/'"
.It Fl n
Show only variable values, not their names.
This option is useful for setting shell variables.
For instance, to save the pagesize in variable
.Va psize ,
use:
.Pp
.Dl "set psize=`nsysctl -n hw.pagesize`"
.It Fl o
Show opaque variables (which are normally suppressed).
The format and length are printed, as well as a hex dump of the first
sixteen bytes of the value.
.It Fl q
Suppress some warnings generated by
.Nm
to standard error.
.It Fl S
[DOC]
.It Fl T
Display only variables that are settable via loader (CTLFLAG_TUN).
.It Fl t
Print the type of the variable.
.It Fl v
[DOC]
.It Fl W
Display only writable variables that are not statistical.
Useful for determining the set of runtime tunable nsysctls.
.It Fl X
Equivalent to
.Fl x a
(for compatibility).
.It Fl x
As
.Fl o ,
but prints a hex dump of the entire value instead of just the first
few bytes.
.It Fl y
[DOC]
.El
.Pp
The information available from
.Nm
consists of integers, strings, and opaque types.
The
.Nm
utility
only knows about a couple of opaque types, and will resort to hexdumps
for the rest.
The opaque information is much more useful if retrieved by special
purpose programs such as
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr systat 1 ,
and
.Xr netstat 1 .
.Pp
Some of the variables which cannot be modified during normal system
operation can be initialized via
.Xr loader 8
tunables.
This can for example be done by setting them in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
Please refer to
.Xr loader.conf 5
for more information on which tunables are available and how to set them.
.Pp
The string and integer information is summarized below.
For a detailed description of these variable see
.Xr sysctl 3 .
.Pp
The changeable column indicates whether a process with appropriate
privilege can change the value.
String and integer values can be set using
.Nm .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
For example, to retrieve the maximum number of processes allowed
in the system, one would use the following request:
.Pp
.Dl "nsysctl kern.maxproc"
.Pp
To set the maximum number of processes allowed
per uid to 1000, one would use the following request:
.Pp
.Dl "nsysctl kern.maxprocperuid=1000"
.Pp
Information about the system clock rate may be obtained with:
.Pp
.Dl "nsysctl kern.clockrate"
.Pp
Information about the load average history may be obtained with:
.Pp
.Dl "nsysctl vm.loadavg"
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Fl w
option has been deprecated and is silently ignored.
